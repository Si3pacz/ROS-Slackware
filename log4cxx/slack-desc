log4cxx:
log4cxx: Log4cxx is a popular logging package written in C++. One of its
log4cxx: distinctive features is the notion of inheritance in loggers. Using a
log4cxx: logger hierarchy it is possible to control which log statements are
log4cxx: output at arbitrary granularity. This helps reduce the volume of
log4cxx: logged output and minimize the cost of logging.
